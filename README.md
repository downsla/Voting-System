# Voting System
CPSC 4360 Software Engineering - Simulating a Voting System in the US 07/04/2021

A Demo of the project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85LGPLAMdiY).
 
The software’s main purpose is simulating a voting system in the United States. The second purpose of the software is to make sure that no one votes more than once.

Instructions:  
You are required to use Java (or another object-oriented programming language) to implement classes according to specific software requirements, especially the persistency requirement. You should be able to demonstrate the functionality of the system through a menu-driven interface. It can be a text-based menu, GUI or web-based interface. Type of interface does not have any impact on project evaluation. You should make all functions very easy to use (user friendly). For example, you should not expect the user to enter all parameters required in one long string. You can use GUI, but you may have to bear the risk of having a system that does not work correctly with the test driver.

Requirements:  
1. To develop a system that will hold information about the data needed and their services.
	1. To be able to display the list of candidates for a given position (Senate, House, President/Vice-President).
	2. To be able to calculate the voter unique ID number based on the voter’s name and current (unique) address.
	3. To be able to input the voter’s choices in the database of candidates.
	4. To be able to interact with the Administrator who will validate these values.
	5. To generate a report about the number of votes each candidate received as well as the number of electors won justifying the results.
	6. To inform the population and the public about the percentage each candidate received.
2. To provide a simulation of a voting process by mentioning a list of candidates for several positions as well as maintaining the vote in a secret way.
   1. If an authorized person wants to see a previous saved voter information, then the software system should provide this service for free.
3. The system must be able of future expansion to incorporate information about the voting system and how to expand it in the future.

The software should include:  
  1. One database containing the eligible voter information in each state. 
  2. Another database containing information about the candidates for Senate, House, Presidency/Vice-President
  3. Your software tool should provide methods to add eligible voters to the database as well as methods to provide the database’s maintenance.
